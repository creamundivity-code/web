# How do we help you as a team to be more efficient and creative?

To be more efficient and creative as a team you need to elaborate facilitation skills, use your creative potential and develop your inter- and intrapersonal relationships. Our tailored "menus" help you to develop all this in a personalised way enjoying it. Since all the "plates" are aligned with each other and usually  facilitated by the same facilitator or team of facilitators, who hence know your team very well, you get the maximum value out of it.

## Facilitation  
_**Boosting your efficiency through facilitation**_

### Workshop Facilitation
We facilitate different kinds of workshops for you:  e.g. your vision, mission and strategy; creativity and innovation workshops, and other important topics you want to decide and elaborate efficently with a group.

### Training of internal facilitators 
We help you to develop a pool of internal facilitators for your "everyday dishes" and occasions when an internal facilitator makes more sense than an external facilitator.  

### How does faciliation à la creamundivity looks like?  
We use a mix of "classical", visual/graphic and kinesthetic facilitation techniques according to the goals and needs of the group. We don't limit ourselves to certain concepts or techniques, but rather use creativity to adapt methods to your personal needs.  

Besides we teach all of the techniques used also to your internal facilitators.  

## Creativity Trainings
_**Liberating and using your creative potential**_  
In different trainings according to your personal development level and skills we train you in liberating and using the creative potential we all have inside of us.

## Team Building  
_**Developing your inter- and intrapersonal relationships**_  
Only working on the level of creativity and facilitation skills en general is not enough to be a highly creative and efficient team.  

That´s why we offer you  team building workshops and individual coaching sessions were we develop the specific inter- and intrapersonal relationships that occur  in your team and/or inside of you.​
